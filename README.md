###Nate Geier Bio
Nate started Interactive Balance in 2009 building custom Learning Management Systems in Flash and PHP for Super 8 Hotels, launching successfully to over 2,000 hotels. Two years later its parent company Wyndham Worldwide wanted the LMS for all 17 major brands worldwide. In early 2012, faced with mobile issues, Nate gambled on the future of Node 0.6 and rewrote and redesigned everything using ExpressJS, MongoDB, MySql and Angular.
