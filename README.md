###Nate Geier
Nate founded Interactive Balance LLC in 2009 building custom Learning Management Systems in Flash and PHP for a multinational hotel brand, launching successfully to over 2,000 hotels and 50,000+ users. Two years later its parent company wanted the LMS for all 17 major brands worldwide. In early 2012, faced with mobile issues, Nate gambled on the future of Node 0.6 and rewrote + redesigned everything using ExpressJS, MongoDB, MySql and Angular. (MEAN)  With its success, the platform was curtailed to 4 other industries.

In September 2013 Nate stopped building custom platforms and focused on [Coursetto](http://coursetto.com), a SaaS mobile ready knowledge-sharing platform that empowers anyone a company to create and curate courses for new and current hires.
