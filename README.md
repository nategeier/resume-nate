###Nate Geier
Nate has been managing and building custom Learning Management Systems and courses from the ground up for worldwide brands since 2009 and using Node.js in production since 2012. In April of 2014, Nate co-founded and launched [Coursetto](http://coursetto.com), a training platform that empowers anyone in a company to create and curate training courses streamlining communication and on-boarding throughout complex organizations. We are disrupting the training world as wordpress did to the custome site developers.

Online training aside, Nate has a unique way of relating to almost anyone on all sides of the corporate and startup community from the engineers and designers to the board of directors. With a journalism degree from the University of Oregon, travels to South Africa, wildland firefighting, college wrestling, motorcycles and surfing, he can get a good connection out of someone in some form or another.

Nate is the most tenacious person you will meet. It's hard to pin him down, but once he has a focus and a goal no matter how big, he will execute.
