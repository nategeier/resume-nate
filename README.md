###Nate Geier Bio
I started Interactive Balance in 2009 building custom Learning Management Systems in Flash and PHP for Super 8 Hotels, launching successfully to over 2,000 hotels. Two years later its parent company Wyndham Worldwide wanted the LMS for all 17 major brands worldwide. In early 2012, faced with mobile issues, I gambled on the future of Node 0.6 and rewrote and redesigned everything using ExpressJS, MongoDB, MySql and Angular.
